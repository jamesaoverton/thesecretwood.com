		<div id="bio">
			<p><a href="http://scottoverton.ca">S.G. Overton</a> has been a professional radio broadcaster for thirty years, 22 of those as host of his own morning show. Specializing in Drama at university, the professional theatre beckoned him, but radio satisfied a need to perform and a lifelong love of music. Even so, writing was, and still is, his first love. He now writes full-time with a number of short stories accepted for publication, and several works in progress in the thriller and science fiction genres.</p>
			<p>Beyond work and writing, Overton gives a lot of time to charities like the United Way, CNIB, the Canadian Red Cross, Easter Seals and many others. Heâ€™s also a big fan of the outdoors and an avid scuba diver.</p>
